# AM-SignUpForm
Maria and Adam's incredible sign up form

Dear Adam I am so sorry but for multiple reasons I am unable to sleep ðŸ˜­

- You could make Franz set the database with You / or connect the form to the database. I wanted to ask him about this on friday but he wasnt available

If you wonder what makes the form look the way it is now:
- Tylewind Styles are defined in tailwind.config.csj, among them all main colors
- css Styles for specific objects (=classes) are defined in style.css

- there is a small function in main.ts that is giving specific elements tailwind attributes.
- You could use this function to style the elements with span tag so that the  label is not the same line as the input field
- You could use this function to style the input fields
